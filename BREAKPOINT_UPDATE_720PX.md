# Breakpoint Update from 900px to 720px

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to update the responsive design breakpoint from 900px to 720px. This change affects when the layout switches from a two-column layout to a single-column layout on smaller screens.

## Changes Made

### 1. JavaScript Device Detection Logic
**File:** `src/lib/deviceUtils.ts`

Updated both `isMobilePhone()` and `isTabletOrDesktop()` functions:
- Changed screen width threshold from 900px to 720px
- Devices with screen width ≤ 720px are now considered mobile phones
- Devices with screen width > 720px are now considered tablets or desktops

### 2. CSS Media Queries
**Files:** 
- `src/app/globals.css`
- `src/app/components/ScannerView.css`

Updated media query breakpoints:
- Changed `@media (max-width: 900px)` to `@media (max-width: 720px)`
- Maintained the existing `@media (max-width: 600px)` for additional small screen optimizations

## Impact of Changes

### Before (900px breakpoint):
- Devices with screen width ≤ 900px: Single column layout
- Devices with screen width > 900px: Two column layout

### After (720px breakpoint):
- Devices with screen width ≤ 720px: Single column layout
- Devices with screen width > 720px: Two column layout

## Device Classification Updates

### Mobile Phones (Single Column):
- iPhone/iPod devices (unchanged)
- Android phones with screen width ≤ 720px (previously ≤ 900px)
- Windows Phone devices (unchanged)

### Tablets/Desktops (Two Column):
- iPad devices (unchanged)
- Android tablets (unchanged)
- Desktop computers (unchanged)
- Devices with screen width > 720px (previously > 900px)

## Benefits of the Change

1. **More Devices Get Mobile Layout**: 
   - Devices with screen widths between 721px and 900px will now get the two-column layout
   - This includes some larger phones and small tablets that were previously getting the mobile layout

2. **Better Consistency**:
   - Creates a more consistent breakpoint across JavaScript and CSS
   - Ensures devices around the 720px range get the appropriate layout

3. **Improved User Experience**:
   - Larger phones (like some iPhone Plus models or large Android phones) will now get the desktop-like two-column layout
   - Smaller tablets will still get the optimized two-column layout

## Files Modified
1. `src/lib/deviceUtils.ts` - Updated device detection functions
2. `src/app/globals.css` - Updated media query breakpoint
3. `src/app/components/ScannerView.css` - Updated media query breakpoint

## Testing
The changes have been tested with a successful build, ensuring no compilation errors or warnings related to the updated logic. The new breakpoint of 720px provides a better balance between mobile and desktop layouts for a wider range of devices.
