# Create Reception Notification Function

## Objective
Enable proper creation of reception completion notifications by creating a database function that can bypass RLS policies.

## Problem
The `createReceptionCompletedNotification` function was failing due to Row Level Security (RLS) policies that prevented direct insertion to the notifications table from client-side code.

## Solution
Created a database function `create_recepcion_completada_notification` that:
- Runs with SECURITY DEFINER to bypass RLS policies
- Handles both notification insertion and notification_reads creation
- Maintains the same logic for determining recipient users
- Preserves deduplication logic

## Changes Made

### Database Changes
- Created new function `create_recepcion_completada_notification` with SECURITY DEFINER
- Granted EXECUTE permissions to authenticated users

### SQL Migration
- Created `sql/015_create_recepcion_notification_function.sql` with the function definition

## Files Modified
- `sql/015_create_recepcion_notification_function.sql` - Database function definition
- `docs/create_recepcion_notification_function.md` - This documentation
- `src/lib/notificationService.ts` - Updated to use the new function

## Testing
- Verified the function properly creates notifications with appropriate read permissions
- Confirmed that reception completion notifications appear in the notification system
- Ensured existing functionality remains unaffected

## Notes
- This function runs with elevated privileges to bypass RLS
- Proper role-based access control is maintained in the function logic
- The function handles duplicate prevention with dedup_key
